<p>Hello! I'm Jordan, a cybersecurity enthusiast focused on hacking platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe. I love solving challenges and learning new techniques.</p>
<br>
<p>This website/blog is going to mainly cover machines on HackTheBox and TryHackMe. These posts are interesting to go through as it slowly shows my notes evolving and becoming more professional. The older notes/machines I did are not super professional and lack screenshots/important information.</p>
